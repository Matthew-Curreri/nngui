# LLaMA 3.3 7B Model

This directory is a placeholder for the LLaMA 3.3 7B model files. Please ensure you have accepted the LLaMA 3.3 license and obtained the model weights before use.

After downloading or converting the LLaMA 3.3 7B model to Hugging Face format, place all model files in this directory. For example, the files should include:
- `config.json` and `tokenizer.model` (or equivalent tokenizer files)
- Model weight files such as `pytorch_model.bin` (or shard files like `pytorch_model-00001-of-00002.bin`, etc.)
- `generation_config.json` (if provided)

Once the model files are placed here, the backend will recognize "llama-3.3-7B" as an available model. You can then fine-tune this model or use it for chat in the application.
